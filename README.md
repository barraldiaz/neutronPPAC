neutronPPAC:
    Programs used on my bachelor thesis dedicated to characterize a neutron detection system formed by 3 PPAC detectors used in GANIL SPIRAL2 
    experiment in France. Among others this programs filter the data, select the interest energy regions, reconstructs the beam, and obtain
    the efficiency varying with the neutron energy or angular dispersion.
